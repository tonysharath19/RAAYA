# TODO List for Gallery Fixes

## 2. Move Cart Icon Next to Grids
- [ ] Remove cart icon from header in gallery.html.
- [ ] Add cart icon next to products-grid in gallery section.
- [ ] Update gallery.css for proper positioning of cart icon in gallery.
- [ ] Adjust gallery.js if needed for cart icon visibility (show in gallery section).

## 3. Testing
